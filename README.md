### CLRS Implementation
---
Implemented the following:
* Sorting Algorithms
    * Bubble Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Calculating number of inversions in Array/Vectors using Merge Sort
* Divide & Conquer
    * Maximum subarray problem
    * Merge Sort (Inside sorting algorithms directory)


---
Left to Implement:
* Linear Time maximum subarray problem

##### P.S.
I would like to mention some conventions which I follow as below:
1. I have used a combination of different programming languages. e.g. c++ and python2
2. Atom text editor adds extra '\n' at end of file, hence I have to remove it when scanning input
3. I supply input through text file as I dont want to supply it every time during program execution.
