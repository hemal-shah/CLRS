    * Bubble Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Calculating number of inversions in Array/Vectors using Merge Sort
* Divide & Conquer
    * Maximum subarray problem
    * Merge Sort (Inside sorting algorithms directory)
    * Stresson's Algorithm for Matrix Multiplication

#### P.S.
I would like to mention some conventions which I follow as below:
1. I have used a combination of different programming languages. e.g. c++ and python2
2. I supply input through text file as I dont want to supply it every time during program execution.
