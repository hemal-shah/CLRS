Left to Implement:
* Linear Time maximum subarray problem
* Didn't go through chap 5

#### P.S.
1. I have used a combination of different programming languages. (C++, Java, Python 2)
2. I supply input through text file as I don't want to supply it every time during program execution. (\n delimited any number of values. )
